* test in wsgi env
  -> if there is no printing python-path wsgi option works as expected

* test on windows

* find how to get path to systemwide python installation
  so it can be called in python.py and it will work on any platform then
  -> could sys.prefix be used?

* create generator command for this environment
  it will take care of python version and stuff
  -> maybe just test a lot this environment
     and use it as a template for normal virtualenv

* where does setuptools install things,
  must it be lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages/?
