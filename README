lightweight python virtual environment
======================================

this directory structure is trying to be a relocatable virtual python environment

it is inspired by virtulenv package a lot, and uses its activate_this.py command

it just tries to replace copying python binary with wrapping it and setting
correct environment variable - which should be just setting PYTHONHOME

which is discussed here in many more details::
