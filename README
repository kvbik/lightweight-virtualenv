======================================
lightweight python virtual environment
======================================

this directory structure is trying to be a relocatable virtual python environment

it is inspired by virtulenv package a lot, and uses its activate_this.py command

if you want to try this, clone it (fork me) and just define PYTHONPATH env
variable pointing at this repository, or call directly {{ REPO }}/bin/python - which
is a shell script or try {{ REPO }}/bin/python.py. python* files are just wrappers,
that sets environment variable for you and passes same arguments to system installed python
